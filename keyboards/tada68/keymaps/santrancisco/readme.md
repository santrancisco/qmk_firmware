# santrancisco's TADA68 layout

The modifications from the default keymap are:

 - Replaced capslock with a second function key - same as stephengrier (thanks dude)
 - Swapped the left ALT and Win key - similar to MAC
 - Added Home+End+Pageup+Pagedown on the IJKL key group
 - Useful trick for terminal: `LeftShift + ESC = ~`
 - Commenting current bash command: `FN+E = Sending {Home key stroke} + Hash`
 - Playing with idea of having a random half of password store in the keyboard so we
 - Enable dynamic macro to record macro on the fly using `FN+C` + `FN+X` then play back using `FN+V`

With this keymap backlight breathing mode can be enabled/disabled with Fn+x.
This is not supported at all in the default keymap.
